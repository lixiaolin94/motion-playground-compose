# Motion Playground Compose

This repository is my practice project for learning the Android Jetpack Compose UI framework. Some of the demo inspirations come from [fluid-interfaces](https://github.com/nathangitter/fluid-interfaces)

## ðŸ’» Requirements

To try out this demo, you need to use [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio).

## ðŸ§© Composable

### SpringConfiguration

Used to configure spring animation properties, it supports:

- Switchable properties that are friendly to designers (WWDC23)
- Real-time visual spring dynamics chart
- Estimate duration estimation without considering the impact of gesture velocity

### SpringAnimationPlayground

A playground driven by spring effects with some common animation properties.

### SpringDynamics

Simulating the physical properties of spring dynamics by connecting the origin and interactive objects with a fake spring.

### DraggableFloatWindow

By tracking the velocity of user gestures when releasing the Draggable Float Window, project the target position and then constrain it to both sides of the screen.

### PopToggleButton

Trigger event changes when using animation process.
